# Station Alpha Frontend Interview Challenges

This repository contains a collection of frontend development challenges designed to assess candidates for the Frontend Developer position at Station Alpha.

## Project Structure

This is a Turborepo-based monorepo containing the following applications:

1. **Bug Hunting** (`apps/bug-hunting`)  
   A React client-side application with intentional bugs for candidates to identify and fix.

2. **Animation Showcase** (`apps/animation-showcase`)  
   A React challenge focused on creating a reusable animated button component with multiple effects (hover, icon support, variants) and accessibility considerations.

3. **API Integration** (`apps/api-integration`)  
   A React application for testing API integration skills with a public weather API.

4. **Playwright Challenge** (`apps/playwright-challenge`)  
   A challenge focused on end-to-end testing using Playwright.

**Important:** Each application directory (`apps/*`) contains its own specific `README.md` file with detailed instructions and context for that particular challenge. Please refer to the README inside the relevant application folder for challenge specifics. Some challenges also include a `questions.md` file that candidates may need to review or answer as part of the assessment.
